# cpp-collection

This is a small repo for learning c++ through solving [coding interview questions](https://github.com/ombharatiya/FAANG-Coding-Interview-Questions) which are used bei FAANG Corporations.

# build

I use [vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [c++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and the [g++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) compiler on windows and the clang compiler on mac (via homebrew). So to build this project without much problems I would recommend installing a c++ compiler and use vs code with the extension. To build it just with the compiler cli you have to look up the documentation.
